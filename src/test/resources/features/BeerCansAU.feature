Pretty much: Beer cans

  Reckon it's like: Counting beer cans
    Y'know I have <opening balance> beer cans
    Too right I have drunk <processed> beer cans
    It's just unbelievable I go to my fridge
    But at the end of the day I reckon I should have <in stock> beer cans
    You'll wanna:
      | opening balance | processed | in stock |
      | 123             | 50        | 73       |
      | 1               | 1         | 1        |
